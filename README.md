# COBOL Project2
  This is a COBOL program which accepts an input file which contains employee's information and outputs a salary report. It was one of the
  projects of my CS-370 (COBOL) class. This program processes input file as detailed in **program2-description** and outputs the salary
  report as outlined in **program2-printer-spacing-chart**.
